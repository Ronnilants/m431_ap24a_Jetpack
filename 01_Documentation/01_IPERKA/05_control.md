# Design testcases

- For the testing we used UAT (User Acceptance Testing), because we only test the UX (User Experience) and we don't have a Website that includes a backend
- Our game is very small and only has a few scripts
- The two functions that we had to test were the controls and the hitbox of the obstacles and what happens if the character collides with the obstacle
- We made two testcases and a testprotocol

## Testcases

- Testcases for the game

# Code Review

- The Code was tested by a relative of Euron that works as a consultant and has some experience in C#
- ****Positive feedback****
  - He told us that our code looks clean and it's good that we used multiple scripts
- ****negative feedback****
  - Naming conventions: What we had to change were the names of the scripts because they were unnecessarily complicated

# Requirement and Docoumentation review
- We looked over the documentation requirements
- We saw what was done and if we had to implement something that was missing

# Test summary

## Testprotocol

- Testprotocol with the results from each person (including name and timestamp)
- The game was tested by Euron's relatives
- The tests went good and no issues were found
