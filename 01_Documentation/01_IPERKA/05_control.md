# Design testcases and testprotocol

- for the testing we used UAT (User Acceptance Testing), because we only test test the User Experience and we don't have a Website with a backend
- Our game is very small and only has a few scripts
- The two functions that we had to test were the controls and the hitbox of the obstacles and what happens if the character touches the obstacles
- We made two testcases and a testprotocol
- The game was tested by Euron's relatives
