# How did we get the Idea?
At first we tought about some games, that we played as kids. Then we came to the good idea to create a own 2D Jetpackgame.

# What type of Information did we need?
Dates:
- We needed to know the important dates and deadlines for our project submission.

Deliverables:

- We needed clarity on what the final product should include and how to submit it to the teacher.
- We needed to understand the topics to cover in our documentation, the format required, and where it should be stored.

Knowledge:

- We needed to research 2D game development and jetpack mechanics, so we looked for relevant tutorials and resources.

Tools required:

- We had to identify the software and tools necessary for developing the game (or find out where to download them).
