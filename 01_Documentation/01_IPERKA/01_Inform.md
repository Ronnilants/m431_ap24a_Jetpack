# How did we get the Idea?
At first we tought about some games, that we played as kids. Then we came to the good idea to create a own 2D Jetpackgame.

# What type of Information did we need?
Dates:
- We needed to know the important dates and deadlines for our project submission.

Deliverables:

- We needed clarity on what the final product should include and how to submit it to the teacher.
- We needed to understand the topics to cover in our documentation, the format required, and where it should be stored.

Knowledge:

- We needed to research 2D game development and jetpack mechanics, so we looked for relevant tutorials and resources.

Tools required:

- We had to identify the software and tools necessary for developing the game (or find out where to download them).

# Gathering Information
Requirements for the Product
- There are 2 sources for requirements, one is the teacher (customer) and the other is from me.
- Thinking about how we wanted my app to work, we wrote a list of things it should do, and then:
- Said if it was about the app or the database.
- Wrote down who wanted these things.

  # Goal
  - How to create a basic game on Unity
     - lern code laguage
     - understand the codes
  - The game has to work
     - the animations have to work
     - You can dodge the object without falling down
     - every time you hit a object you will fall down
     - It has to have a start and pause button
     - the background has to be seen
