# Assessment

## What went well
- learnig Markdown: The whole documentation was written in Markdown so we had much time to learn it. We learned how to style the text, add images, videos and files. We can Use it now without problems, not like at the beginning.
- IPERKA: We understand now why we need the IPERKA and how it should be structured
## What could be improved 
- Teamwork: We didnt work together as a real team and had different opinions about what we wanted
- Product: because we didnt have done the code earlier, we had to cut many things of the product
- plan: Our plan was good but we didnt keep up with it
## Were the goals achieved
- How to create a basic game in Unity
    - We learned how to make a basic game in Unity, by creating this product and watching tutorials about C# and Unity. We think this goal was achieved because we learned how to make a basci game even if our product isnt really good
- the game has to work
    - The game works but not because we are that good at working with unity and coding in C# but, because we cutted most of the original features from the game. The goal wasnt achieved but we know what our mistake was and what we need to change fot the future
## Evaluate the plan
- In our resource plan we had 104 available hours
- In our estimated time consumption in the task list we needed 79 hours
- Our personal goar was to need about 80 hours of those 104 available hours
- We actually used about 40 hours for everything, from learning Unity to writing the assess part
- Conclusion: We should have put alot more hours into the project and cooperate more with eachother. If we had put all the hours into it, our product would have been significantly better.
